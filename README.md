# ASD
 The Alternating Search Directions method (ASD) is an iterative technique to solve the power flow problem of traditional electric power systems. The main reference can be found in [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378779616302292).

### Relevant files:

* ***Escrit/bare_jrnl.pdf***: paper detailing the algorithm, the PV bus modeling and the changes in search directions that improve the performance.
* ***Code/ASD.py***: code in Python that solves the loaded grid with the ASD method. There are two grids that serve as examples: the IEEE14 and the IEEE30-bus system. It is highly encouraged to take them as references when trying to simulate other grids.

All this was possible thanks to the help I received from Santiago Pe√±ate Vera.
