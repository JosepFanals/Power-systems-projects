An efficient methodology aimed at the parametric analysis of power systems has been presented. It allows obtaining a polynomial that relates a state of interest with the parameters. It achieves so by reducing the dimensions of the initial problem to a few meaningful dimensions. Thus, a bit of precision is sacrificed so as to generate a fast and generic solution, ideal for systems planning. 

It has to be mentioned that for the most part, the application of this technique remains unpopular. It borrows well-known concepts such as orthogonal decomposition, widely used in other fields. However, up to now, there are almost no studies on how it performs when analyzing power systems. It seems to be a promising technique, with potential applications on time series, real-time computing, and fault analysis. Combining it with power electronics could be a potentially rewarding step forward.
